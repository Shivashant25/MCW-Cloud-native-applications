## Exercise 2: Deploy the solution to Azure Kubernetes Service

**Duration**: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will connect to the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster you created before the hands-on lab and deploy the Docker application to the cluster using Kubernetes.

### Task 1: Tunnel into the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster

In this task, you will gather the information you need about your Azure Kubernetes Service cluster to connect to the cluster and execute commands to connect to the Kubernetes management dashboard from cloud shell.

> **Note**: The following tasks should be executed in cloud shell and not the build machine, so disconnect from build machine if still connected.

1. Verify that you are connected to the correct subscription with the following command to show your default subscription:

   ```bash
   az login
   az account show
   ```

   - If you are not connected to the correct subscription, list your subscriptions and then set the subscription by its id with the following commands (similar to what you did in cloud shell before the lab):

   ```bash
   az account list
   az account set --subscription {id}
   ```

2. Configure kubectl to connect to the Kubernetes cluster. Replace the `SUFFIX` placeholder with **<inject key="DeploymentID" />**.

   ```bash
   az aks get-credentials -a --name fabmedical-SUFFIX --resource-group fabmedical-SUFFIX
   ```

3. Test that the configuration is correct by running a simple kubectl command to produce a list of nodes:

   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

   ![In this screenshot of the console, kubectl get nodes has been typed and run at the command prompt, which produces a list of nodes.](media/image75.png "kubectl get nodes")

### Task 2: Deploy a service using the Azure Portal

In this task, you will deploy the API application to the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster using the Azure Portal.

1. From the Azure Portal, select the resource group named **fabmedical-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**, and then select your Kubernetes Service Azure resource.

   ![In this screenshot, the resource group was previously selected and the AKS cluster is selected.](media_prod/ex3tsk7-step1.png "Select fabmedical resource group")
   
   >**Note**: If you notice a permission warning related to Kubernetes dynamic resource group. Please ignore and continue with the lab.
   
2. Define a new Namespace for our API deployment. Select the **Namespaces (1)** blade of the fabmedical-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> AKS resource detail page of the Azure Portal. On the Namespaces tab click **+ Create (2)** and select **Create with YAML (3)**.

   ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS showing adding a Namespace.](media_prod/cna22.png "Add a Namespace")

3. In the **Create with YAML** screen, paste the following YAML and click on **Add**.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: ingress-demo
      name: ingress-demo
    ```

4. Define a Service for our API so that the application is accessible within the cluster. Select the **Services and ingresses (1)** blade of the fabmedical-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> AKS resource detail page of the Azure Portal. On the Services tab, click on **+ Create (2)** and select **Create with YAML (3)**.

   ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS showing adding a Service.](media_prod/cna23.png "Add a Service")

5. In the **Create with YAML** screen, paste following YAML and click on **Add**.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: api
      name: api
      namespace: ingress-demo
    spec:
      ports:
        - name: api-traffic
          port: 3001
          protocol: TCP
          targetPort: 3001
      selector:
        app: api
      sessionAffinity: None
      type: ClusterIP
    ```

6. Now select **Workloads** under the **Kubernetes resources** section in the left navigation.

    ![Select workloads under Kubernetes resources.](media/2021-03-25-17-04-35.png "Select workloads under Kubernetes resources")

7. From the Workloads view, with **Deployments** selected (the default) then select **+ Create** with **Create with YAML**.

   ![Selecting + Add to create a deployment.](media_prod/cna27.png "Selecing + Add to create a deployment")

8. In the **Create with YAML** screen that loads paste the following YAML and Update the `[LOGINSERVER]` placeholder with **fabmedical<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** to match the name of your ACR Login Server.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      labels:
          app: api
      name: api
      namespace: ingress-demo
    spec:

          - image: [LOGINSERVER].azurecr.io/content-api
            env:
              - name: MONGODB_CONNECTION
                valueFrom:
                  secretKeyRef:
                    name: cosmosdb
                    key: db
            name: api
            imagePullPolicy: Always
            livenessProbe:
              httpGet:
                  path: /
                  port: 3001
              initialDelaySeconds: 30
              periodSeconds: 20
              timeoutSeconds: 10
              failureThreshold: 3
            ports:
              - containerPort: 3001
                hostPort: 3001
                protocol: TCP
            resources:
              requests:
                  cpu: 200m
                  memory: 128Mi
            securityContext:
              privileged: false
            terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
            terminationMessagePolicy: File
          dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
          restartPolicy: Always
          schedulerName: default-scheduler
          securityContext: {}
          terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
    ```

9. Click on **Add** to initiate the deployment. This can take a few minutes after which you will see the deployment listed.

   ![Service is showing as unhealthy](media/2021-03-25-17-05-36.png "Service is showing as unhealthy")

10. Select the **api** deployment to open the failing Deployment and observe the failing pod.

    ![Pod is showing as unhealthy](media/failing-pod.png "Service pod is showing as unhealthy")

11. Select the failing pod from the list of pods in the `api` deployment and select **Events**.  Observe that the pod is failing to start because the `cosmosdb` secret is not present.

    ![cosmosdb secret is missing](media/missing-secret-event.png "Pod is failing because of a missing secret")

12. In the Azure Portal navigate to your resource group and find your Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB account. Select the Cosmos DB resource to view details.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal showing the Cosmos DB among existing resources.](media_prod/cna17.png)

13. Under **Quick Start** select the **Node.js** tab and copy the **Node.js 3.0 connection string**.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal showing the quick start for setting up Cosmos DB with MongoDB API. The copy button is highlighted.](media/Ex2-Task1.10.png "Capture CosmosDB connection string")

14. Modify the copied connection string by adding the database `contentdb` to the URL, along with a replicaSet of `globaldb`. The resulting connection string should look like the below sample. Note that you may need to modify the endpoint URL.

    ```text
    mongodb://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@fabmedical-<SUFFIX>.mongo.cosmos.azure.com:10255/contentdb?ssl=true&replicaSet=globaldb
    ```
    
    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure cloud shell window showing the command to create the base64 encoded secret.  The output to copy is highlighted.](https://github.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-Cloud-native-applications/blob/fix/Hands-on%20lab/local/connnectionstring.png?raw=true "Show encoded secret")

15. You will setup a Kubernetes secret to store the connection string and configure the `content-api` application to access the secret. First, you must base64 encode the secret value. Open your Azure Cloud Shell window and use the following command to encode the connection string and then, copy the output.

    > **Note**: Double quote marks surrounding the connection string are required to successfully produce the required output.

    ```bash
    echo -n "[CONNECTION STRING VALUE]" | base64 -w 0 - | echo $(</dev/stdin)
    ```

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure cloud shell window showing the command to create the base64 encoded secret.  The output to copy is highlighted.](media/hol-2019-10-18_07-12-13.png "Show encoded secret")

16. Return to the AKS blade in the Azure Portal and select **Configuration (1)** under the **Kubernetes resources** section. Select **Secrets (2)** and choose **+ Create (3)** with **Create with YAML**.

    ![](media_prod/cna24.png)

17. In the **Create with YAML** screen, paste following YAML and replace the placeholder with the encoded connection string from your clipboard and choose **Add**. Note that YAML is position sensitive so you must ensure indentation is correct when typing or pasting.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: cosmosdb
      namespace: ingress-demo
    type: Opaque
    data:
      db: <base64 encoded value>
    ```

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS howing the YAML file for creating a deployment.](media_prod/cna25.png "Upload YAML data")

18. Sort the Secrets list by name and you should now see your new secret displayed.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS showing secrets.](media/find-cosmosdb-secret.png "Manage Kubernetes secrets")

19. View the details for the **cosmosdb** secret by selected it in the list.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS showing the value of a secret.](media_prod/cna26.png "View cosmosdb secret")

20. Create a new deployment manifest, `api.deployment.yml` and add the YAML content below to the file. Update the `[LOGINSERVER]` placeholder with **fabmedical<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** to match the name of your ACR Login Server.

    ```bash
